## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

dplyrâ€˜s select() function:

select(customers,age,gender)

select() takes a data frame as its first argument
all additional arguments are the desired columns to select
select() returns a new data frame containing only the desired columns
But what about the pipe %>%, you ask? Great question. You can simplify the readability of your code by using the pipe:

customers %>%
  select(age,gender)

When using the pipe, you can read the code as: 
from the customers table, select() the age and gender columns. 
From now on we will use the pipe symbol where appropriate to simplify our code.


```{r}
# load data frame
artists <- read_csv('artists.csv')
head(artists)
```

```{r}
# select one column
artist_groups <- artists %>%
  select(group)

artist_groups
```

```{r}
# select multiple columns
group_info <- artists %>%
  select(group, spotify_monthly_listeners, year_founded)
group_info

```


To exclude the columns you do not need:

customers %>%
  select(-name,-phone)

the data frame customers is piped into select()
the columns to remove, prepended with a -, are given as arguments
a new data frame without the name and phone columns is returned

```{r}
# select all columns except one
no_albums <- artists %>%
  select(-albums)
no_albums

```

```{r}
# select all columns except a set
df_cols_removed <- artists %>%
  select(-genre, -spotify_monthly_listeners, -year_founded)
df_cols_removed


```


orders %>%
  filter(shoe_material == 'faux-leather',price > 25)

the orders data frame is again piped into filter()
the conditions shoe_material == 'faux-leather' and price > 25 are given as arguments

```{r}
# filter rows one condition
rock_groups <- artists %>%
  filter(genre=="Rock")
rock_groups

```

```{r}
# filter rows multiple conditions
popular_rock_groups <- artists %>%
  filter(genre=="Rock", spotify_monthly_listeners >20000000)
popular_rock_groups
```

You are interested in seeing all orders that were for 'clogs' OR that cost less than 20. Using the or operator (|):

orders %>%
  filter(shoe_type == 'clogs' | price < 20)
  
  What if you want to find all orders where shoes in any color but red were purchased. Using the not or bang operator (!):

orders %>%
  filter(!(shoe_color == 'red'))


```{r}
```{r}
# filter rows with or
korea_or_before_2000 <- artists %>%
  filter(country=="South Korea"|year_founded < 2000)
korea_or_before_2000

```

```{r}
# filter rows with not !

not_rock_groups <- artists %>%
  filter(!(genre=='Rock'))
not_rock_groups

```

To arrange the customers in ascending order by name:

customers %>%
  arrange(name)
  
arrange() can also order rows by descending order! To arrange the customers in descending order by age:

customers %>%
  arrange(desc(age))
  
  
```{r}
# arrange rows in ascending order
group_asc <- artists %>%
arrange(group)
group_asc #Alphabecially

group_asc <- artists %>%
arrange(desc(group))
group_asc #Reverse-alphebetically
```

```{r}
# arrange rows in descending order
youtube_desc <- artists %>%
arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
youtube_desc
```
  
  
# select columns
chosen_cols <- artists %>% 
  select(-country,-year_founded,-albums)
head(chosen_cols)

```{r}
# filter rows
popular_not_hip_hop <- chosen_cols %>% 
  filter(spotify_monthly_listeners > 20000000, genre != 'Hip Hop') 
head(popular_not_hip_hgit op)
```

```{r}
# arrange rows
youtube_desc <- popular_not_hip_hop %>% 
  arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))
head(youtube_desc)
```

```{r}
# select columns, filter and arrange rows

artists <- artists %>% 
  select(-country, -year_founded, -albums) %>% 
  filter(spotify_monthly_listeners>20000000, !(genre=='Hip Hop')) %>%
  arrange(desc(youtube_subscribers))

head(artists)
```

df %>%
  mutate(sales_tax = price * 0.075)

Now the inventory table has a column called sales_tax, where the value is 0.075 * price:


```{r}
# add average height column
dogs <- dogs %>% 
  mutate(avg_height =((height_low_inches+height_high_inches)/2))

head(dogs)
```


```{r}

print(dogs)
